* https://metanorma.github.io/mn-samples-ogc/[OGC Publications in Metanorma (HTML)]

== General

This repository contains three documents converted to Metanorma
format from the OGC series, used to demonstrate usage
of Metanorma in the OGC context.

Documents shown include:

* Web Feature Service (WFS)
** Repo: https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-wfs

* Technical Committee Policies and Procedures
** Repo: https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-tcpnp


== Structure

`repos/`::
git repositories of Metanorma OGC documents (branch `gh-pages`), added as
submodules in this directory. These are the Metanorma XML documents
we need here.

`source/`::
(automatically generated) extracted Metanorma XML documents from `repos/`.
This is where the Metanorma XML documents will be processed into output
formats. +
_Note: `17-069r3/` includes plenty of samples of Metanorma requirements._

`documents/`::
(automatically generated) generated Metanorma output from XML files
in `source/`.

`published/`::
(automatically generated) published Metanorma OGC documents together
with the Relaton index (`index.html`).


== Usage

This repository uses `metanorma` to run these processes.

=== Pre-requisites

* Make sure to initialize submodules:
  the easiest way is to clone this repository with `--recursive` flag.

----
metanorma site generate . -o published -c metanorma.yml
